	    <p class="description1">My name is Kevin Zhang. I come from a Chinese family. I was born in Milan, Italy in July 20th, 1995. My father is a salesman who keep running between Europe and China. I spent half of my childhood in Italy while other half in China. I am not the only child in the family, I have an elder brother and we’ve grew up together. Since I am the youngest, I can feel that my parents care more about me than my brother. Currently, I am an undergraduate student in University of Wisconsin-Madison, majoring in computer science. I spent most of my time on coding and debugging, and using my computer became a part of my life. I am skilled in the following languages: Java, HTML, CSS, Javascript, C.</p>

    	<p class="description2">I started playing videogames since I was a child. My parents bought a PlayStation 1 console as a gift for my brother’s birthday. Since then, my brother and I spent a lot of time on games. I got my first console as a gift for my 13th years birthday, it was a Nintendo Wii. I have promised my parents that I will not spent too much time on videogames but on study. However, I still played a lot of games when my parents are not at home. During last year of high-school, I started playing a computer game called League of Legends, I admit, this game is so fun that I still play a lot. After I came to college, I bought a gaming desktop and I started to play various kind of computer games. Some of the games I play include: League of Legends, Overwatch, PlayerUnknownBattleGround, Minecraft, H1Z1:KotK, Final Fantasy XIV, Fifa 18, Resident Evil, Civilization VI, Grand Theft Auto V, Revelation Online, Black Desert etc.</p>
